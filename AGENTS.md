# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Build

Submodules are required before anything builds - a fresh clone or worktree needs
`git submodule update --init --recursive` (`libwhisper/whisper.cpp` and `asian-autocorrect`).

`./run.sh build` builds everything (CMake for whisper.cpp, cargo for the autocorrect dylib,
then `xcodebuild`); `./run.sh` also launches the app. CI runs exactly `./run.sh build`
(`.github/workflows/build.yml`) and does not run tests.

## Tests

```
xcodebuild test -scheme OpenSuperWhisper -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -skipPackagePluginValidation -skipMacroValidation \
  -clonedSourcePackagesDirPath SourcePackages CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO -only-testing:OpenSuperWhisperTests
```

Five tests fail on any machine without the right hardware and TCC grants, independent of your
change - verify against a clean checkout before assuming you broke them:
`ClipboardUtilPasteIntegrationTests` (drives TextEdit through Accessibility) and the
`MicrophoneService*` cases that reach real CoreAudio devices.

Targets use Xcode file-system-synchronized groups, so new source and test files are picked up
without editing `project.pbxproj`.

## Engines

`OpenSuperWhisper/Engines/EngineKind.swift` owns the engine registration, persistence,
factory, and language-handling contracts. Follow its documentation when adding an engine.

`OpenSuperWhisper/Engines/Audio/` is the engine-neutral audio path every engine shares:
16 kHz PCM decoding, the bundled Silero VAD, and chunking for engines with an input ceiling.
An engine must not reach into another engine for any of it. Engines whose backend rejects or
silently clamps long input take `AudioChunkSource` with an `AudioChunkBudget`; the budget type
documents why each limit exists and `OpenSuperWhisperTests/AudioChunkerTests.swift` pins them.

Model weights are downloaded at runtime and never bundled into the `.app` - some are
redistributed under licences that require attribution and forbid rebranding. Any engine whose
model the app downloads needs an entry in `docs/speech-model-attribution.md`.

Engine limits are measured against the pinned FluidAudio, not read off its config constants,
because several of them mislead. Defects found there that the app ships around rather than
patches - and the reasons - live in `docs/upstream-issues.md`; add to it instead of rediscovering
them. Model-backed regression tests are opt-in on locally generated fixtures under
`OpenSuperWhisperTests/Fixtures/` (gitignored); each engine's integration test documents how to
generate its own, and fixture filenames must be unique across engines because the test bundle
flattens them all into one Resources directory.

## Storage

The recordings database is GRDB, with its full schema history in `RecordingStore.makeMigrator()`
(`OpenSuperWhisper/Models/Recording.swift`). Schema changes go in a new named migration; never
edit an applied one, since the identifier is what decides whether a user's database already ran it.

`terms.json` beside it is the second store: the personal terms dictionary, deliberately a plain
hand-editable file outside the database because it has a different lifecycle and must not be
touched by the recordings retention policy. See `docs/personal-terms.md`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
